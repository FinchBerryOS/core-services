# FinchBerryOS Core Services & Launch Infrastructure

Welcome to the central nervous system of **FinchBerryOS**. This repository manages the system binaries, high-level service bundles, and the launch configurations that orchestrate the transition from the Linux kernel to a fully functional, sovereign userland.

## 🏗 Service Hierarchy & Architecture

FinchBerryOS employs a tiered architectural approach to separate critical boot logic from high-level system services and UI components.

### 1. The Boot & Machine Layer (Naked Binaries)
Essential system components and "invisible" workers. These are naked binaries located in protected system paths, hidden from the user's default execution path (`$PATH`).
* **`/sbin/syscored`**: The heart of the OS (PID 1). Invoked directly by the kernel. It also runs as `syscored --user` within isolated user namespaces to supervise user-level tasks.
* **`/usr/libexec/`**: The system's "engine room." Contains core daemons and internal maintenance tools.

### 2. The High-Level Layer (Bundles)
Located in `/System/Library/CoreServices`, this layer contains complex services packaged as bundles to include resources, assets, and metadata.
* **`.serviceb` (Service Bundles)**: Integrated background services with resource requirements (e.g., `Bluetooth.serviceb`).
* **`.appb` (App Bundles)**: Critical system-level UI applications (e.g., `WindowServer.appb`, `LoginUI.appb`).

### 3. Launch Configurations
`syscored` scans these directories to manage the lifecycle, dependencies, and entitlements of all services using **Socket Activation**.
* **`/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` & `LaunchAgents/`**: Immutable system service definitions.
* **`/Library/LaunchDaemons/` & `LaunchAgents/`**: Administrator or third-party service definitions.
